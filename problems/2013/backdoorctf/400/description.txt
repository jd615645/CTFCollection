Now, this is an open challenge. h4x0r has created his own encryption algorithm and has decided to challenge all the hackers in the world. He has made the code public here.

He challenges you to find the text he has encrypted and promises to reward you handsomely if you manage to do so. To make things simpler he has also given you the hint that the text he has encrypted is only alphanumeric.

The text encrypted using the above algorithm is:

168 232 100 162 135 179 112 100 173 206 106 123 106 195 179 157 123 173
The flag is the MD5 of the decrypted text.

HINT: Sometimes the most direct approach gives the answer
