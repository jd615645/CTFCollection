Hey you! Come over and help me, please. We discovered a strange key agreement protocol used on this server: ctf.fluxfingers.net:1330. They send a curve which they use later. But we think the robots are a bit UBER-cautious and do not use the curve's P. So they first exchange their public point with a technique we could not figure out. It looks like they do not need a public key for this step. Afterwards they use another technique to agree on a key which they ultimately use to send some encrypted password.

We need this last password to shut down the robo-factory on our way to the Oktoberfest.

Oh btw, the robots use AES-ECB for symmetric encryption.

Hint: He, we have the latest news for you. The first part of their strange key agreement was designed by the famous SHA-Robot Мир! For all robo hunters out there: Your quest-description was updated - check it!
