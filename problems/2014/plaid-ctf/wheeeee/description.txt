Although it seems like The Plague's messaging service is secure, there are bound to be bugs in any 20th century crypto system. We've recovered a version of the block cipher The Plague implemented. Use their online encryptor tool, at 54.82.75.29:8193, to break the cipher and figure out Plague's secret plans.

NOTE: When the service sends you a hex-encoded string, respond with a hex-encoded string.
