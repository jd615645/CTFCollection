We found a Daedalus Corp command server, that lets people read some shared files. But it requires cryptographically signed commands! Can you forge a signature for us? It's running at vuln2014.picoctf.com. The JAR file for the service is here.
Hint:

The service's signature checks are incomplete: can you figure out a way to put in some garbage? In particular, we think it may be vulnerable to a similar bug that Mozilla's NSS library was recently: see here.
