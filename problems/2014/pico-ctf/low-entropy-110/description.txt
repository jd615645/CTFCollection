Daedalus Corp's spy in Thyrin Labs seems to sometimes use an encrypted drop box for their messages. We intercepted one of their messages, but we don't seem to be able to decrypt it. Fortunately, we have the source and the address of their key generation server: maybe there's a way to use that to decrypt their message? Unfortunately, we don't have their list of cached primes... Their source, and our intercepted message, are here. The key generation service is running at vuln2014.picoctf.com:51818.
Hint:

We're pretty sure that 30 total possible primes is low enough that we should be able to correlate different keys somehow...
