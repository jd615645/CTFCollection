The folowing plaintext has been encrypted using an unknown key, with AES-128 CBC:
Original:   Pass: sup3r31337. Don't loose it!
Encrypted:  4f3a0e1791e8c8e5fefe93f50df4d8061fee884bcc5ea90503b6ac1422bda2b2b7e6a975bfc555f44f7dbcc30aa1fd5e
IV:         19a9d10c3b155b55982a54439cb05dce

How would you modify it so that it now decrypts to: "Pass: notAs3cre7. Don't loose it!"

This challenge does not have a specific flag format.



(PS. This solution doesn't have the flag, but it's explanation is the best. So I put the answer in the file named flag.txt.)
