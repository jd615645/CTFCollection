Wow, what's this, Soos?

It's the Confederacy's cipher disk with a help of which southerners encrypted their messages.
How does it work?

Look, Dipper. We need to encode the phrase MABLE EATS SPRINKLES. We don't need any spaces so just delete them. We get MABLEEATSSPRINKLES. Then we have too choose a key. Let it be GRAVITY. And let's go !!! You see, we've encrypted the phrase and here it is RBZTXYZJSKZBLQCEN
Cool!

Now I'll encode a famous story and you'll try to decode it. By the way, it's much more interesting to read the whole story over, isn't it?

That's complicated. Maybe I have to find a key at first. I'd better look for someone who is able to solve this...

Don't forget to reach to the end of the text! The ending is greatly important.
